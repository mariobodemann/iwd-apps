# IWD App: Rose

This rose is a present to all the women in my life. Thank you for being part of it.

It heavily uses the tutorials for Android Filament on [Medium by Philip Rideout](https://medium.com/@philiprideout/getting-started-with-filament-on-android-d10b16f0ec67) and the official [Google Filament for Android examples](https://github.com/google/filament/tree/main/android/samples). The rose itself is "bought" from [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-model-rose-1242547), translated, scaled and slightly altered by using [blender](http://blender.org/) (Remember to use `--python-use-system-env` for the GLB export to find Numpy).


## Adding new environments

If you feel the backgrounds of the rose, changeable by restarting the app, or tapping on the text, needs more options, please feel free to add a png to the [./assets](./assets), run the [create envs script](assets/create_envs.sh), if you got the [fillament tools](https://github.com/google/filament/releases/latest) installed or on your path.
